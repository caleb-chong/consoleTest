        <h1>Using CSS</h1>
        <p>This page contains some text that we can use to work with styles and change the way some of the elements appear on the page.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Styles give us consistency on the page</li>
            <li>Styles make it fast and easy to change the look of a page</li>
            <li>Styles are powerful and have many features that can considerably improve the look of a page</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Creating a style for a built in tag:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Specify the name of the tag</li>
            <li>Add each style element and its value to the list</li>
            <li>Multiple elements are separated by a ";" and usually placed on separate lines to increase readability</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Creating a style for a named section of the page:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Identify the id for that block of text</li>
            <li>Specify the id of the of the text using a "#" before the id</li>
            <li>Add each style element and its value to the list</li>
            <li>Multiple elements are separated by a ";" and usually placed on separate lines to increase readability</li>       
        </ol>

        <p>Like the first paragraph of this page, this text is enclosed in a paragraph tag.  But we can give it an id so it can be formatted separately from other any other paragraph.</p>
