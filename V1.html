                <p>
                    The Canadian Definition of Homelessness defines homelessness as “the situation of an individual, family or community without stable, safe, permanent, appropriate housing, or the immediate prospect, means, and ability of acquiring it.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    People who are homeless do not have a place to call their own. Many homeless people spend each day on the streets, under bridges, or in ravines because they have nowhere to go. The Ontario government has constructed homeless shelters where homeless people can eat a meal each day and stay for the night, but there is not enough room for everybody in these shelters and sometimes shelter conditions can be unsafe. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Most people who suffer from homelessness are not homeless by choice. What many homeless people want most is the chance to connect and socialize with others. They often don’t have many healthy relationships or people to be there for them when they need them. Not enough people listen to or value them. Many homeless people say that the loss of dignity that accompanies homelessness can be worse than the loss of their physical homes.

                    People become homeless for many different reasons. Some reasons why people become homeless are:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>

                            They cannot pay for rent anymore: 
                        </b>
                        Rent prices are increasing at an alarming rate, and people are sometimes unable to cope with increased rent rates, so they become homeless.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>

                            They lose their source of income: 
                        </b>
                        Some people become homeless because they lose their source of income. Without income, they are unable to pay for housing and essential needs and thus become homeless.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>

                            Their home was unsafe: 
                        </b>
                        Many people leave their homes because their living conditions were unsafe. This could be because of overcrowding, abuse, structural damage, and substandard living conditions. 
                    </li>
                    <br>

                        </b>
                        Millions of people in the world are forced to flee their homes to avoid danger. They are forced to leave everything they have to go somewhere else in the pursuit of a better life. When they get to a new area, they are unable to find or afford housing because they left everything behind.
                    </li>

                            Their home was sold:
                        </b>
                        Many houses are torn down to make way for larger buildings such as condos, apartments, and malls. Some people lose their homes for this reason, and with nowhere to go, they become homeless.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        <b>
                            They didn't have enough support:
                        </b>
                        Many people become homeless because they have no support after leaving prison, hospital, or armed forces. Without support, these people have nowhere to go but the streets.

                    Homelessness is becoming a very serious problem in Ontario, especially in Toronto, a city that lacks affordable housing. Homelessness can happen to anybody; nobody is safe from homelessness, because nobody knows what could happen in the future that might make them homeless. Homelessness impacts not only the homeless but all of society because it affects:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>
                            Public Security: 
                        </b>
                        Many homeless people suffer from mental health or addiction issues. These issues are usually inflicted by their pasts and the experiences they had to go through. These people tend to impose these problems on others, and consequently, areas with higher homeless populations have higher crime rates.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        <b>
                            Public Health and Healthcare Availability: 
                        </b>
                        Homeless people are at a high risk of catching diseases such as tuberculosis or Hepatitis A since they are exposed to numerous individuals each day on the streets. If a homeless person catches one of these transmissible sicknesses, they cannot stay at home and thus pose the risk of transmitting it to others. Homelessness also affects the availability of healthcare resources because homeless people use many of these resources, which are sometimes limited.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>

                            Community Life:
                        </b>
                        Homelessness affects community life by creating social barriers between people who suffer from homelessness and people who do not. Some homeless people are afraid to reach out for help for fear of being judged, while people who aren't homeless are often unable to grasp the severity of homelessness. Consequently, an intangible wall is driven between the two groups.
                    </li>
                    <br>

                        <b>
                            Government Spending: 
                        </b>
                        The government of Ontario has poured and continues to pour millions of dollars into fighting homelessness. Homeless people do not pay tax but are high consumers of public resources and services, so they generate more cost than gain to society. However, a study showed that the costs of public services that homeless people used dropped significantly after these homeless people were given a roof over their heads. Hence, by helping the homeless to find homes, society can decrease the amount of money that the government spends on fighting homelessness. This would allow the government to turn more tax money towards other matters such as healthcare availability and building infrastructure.
